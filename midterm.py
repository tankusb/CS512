# Midterm project
# Written by Ben Tankus 2-6-21

#You will have three major tasks, 
# one is to wrangle the data into a format that allows you to do work on it and load it into a database.
    # DONE in group project


 
 
# The next is to answer 3 questions about your data which are moderately complex and provide accompanying visualizations if appropriate (at least 3 total), 
    #Questions: 
        # 1. Is it worth getting more pans dirty? (Is there a positive correlation between spoonscore and equipment count)
            # Viz - Scatter of pan-count to spoon score
        # 2. What factor contributes the most to spoonscore - Linear Regression - Correlation matrix (check dependent), scatter plot (check assumptions), Bar chart (show relative impact)
        # 3. Are vegan recipes more expensive? - Scatter
    
    #In addition to simply answering the question you should come up with at least 3 visualizations total




# you also need to end up with your data inside an relational database. A local SQLite database would be sufficient.
    #You should load as much of your data as possible into a relational database.
