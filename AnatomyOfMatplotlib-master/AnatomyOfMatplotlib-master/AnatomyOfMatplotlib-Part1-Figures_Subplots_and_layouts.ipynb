    "## Introduction\n",
    "Matplotlib is a library for producing publication-quality figures. mpl (for short) was designed from the beginning to serve two purposes. First, allow for interactive, cross-platform control of figures and plots, and second, to make it very easy to produce static raster or vector graphics files without the need for any GUIs. Furthermore, mpl -- much like Python itself -- gives the developer complete control over the appearance of their plots, while still being very usable through a powerful defaults system."

    "## Online Documentation\n",
    "The [matplotlib.org](http://matplotlib.org) project website is the primary online resource for the library's documentation. It contains [examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html), [FAQs](http://matplotlib.org/faq/index.html), [API documentation](http://matplotlib.org/api/index.html), and, most importantly, the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gallery\n",
    "Many users of Matplotlib are often faced with the question, \"I want to make a figure that has X with Y in the same figure, but it needs to look like Z\". Good luck getting an answer from a web search with that query! This is why the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) is so useful, because it showcases the variety of ways one can make figures. Browse through the gallery, click on any figure that has pieces of what you want to see and the code that generated it. Soon enough, you will be like a chef, mixing and matching components to produce your masterpiece!\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, if you have a new and interesting plot that demonstrates a feature of Matplotlib, feel free to submit a concise, well-commented version of the code for inclusion in the gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mailing Lists and StackOverflow\n",
    "When you are just simply stuck, and cannot figure out how to get something to work, or just need some hints on how to get started, you will find much of the community at the matplotlib-users [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users). This mailing list is an excellent resource of information with many friendly members who just love to help out newcomers. The number one rule to remember with this list is to be persistant. While many questions do get answered fairly quickly, some do fall through the cracks, or the one person who knows the answer isn't available. Therefore, try again with your questions rephrased, or with a plot showing your attempts so far. We love plots, so an image showing what is wrong often gets the quickest responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another community resource is [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib), so if you need to build up karma points, submit your questions here, and help others out too! We are also on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib).\n",

    "## Github repository\n",
    "### Location\n",
    "[Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib) is hosted by GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bug Reports and feature requests\n",
    "So, you think you found a bug? Or maybe you think some feature is just too difficult to use? Or missing altogether? Submit your bug reports [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues) at Matplotlib's issue tracker. We even have a process for submitting and discussing Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals ([MEPs](http://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/MEP/index.html))."

    "Normally we wouldn't need to think about this too much, but IPython/Jupyter notebooks behave a touch differently than \"normal\" python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of IPython, it's often easiest to use the Jupyter ``nbagg`` or ``notebook`` backend.  This allows plots to be displayed and interacted with in the browser in a Jupyter notebook.  Otherwise, figures will pop up in a separate GUI window.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The IPython ``%matplotlib backend_name`` \"magic\" command (or ``plt.ion()``, which behaves similarly)\n",
    "   - Figures will be shown automatically by IPython, even if you don't call ``plt.show()``.\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. ``matplotlib.use(\"backend_name\")``\n",
    "   - Figures will only be shown when you call ``plt.show()``.\n",

    "Here, we'll use the second method for one simple reason: it allows our code to behave the same way regardless of whether we run it inside of an Jupyter notebook or from a python script at the command line.  Feel free to use the ``%matplotlib`` magic command if you'd prefer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most plotting ocurs on an ``Axes``.  The axes is effectively the area that we plot data on and any ticks/labels/etc associated with it.  Usually we'll set up an Axes with a call to ``subplot`` (which places Axes on a regular grid), so in most cases, ``Axes`` and ``Subplot`` are synonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ``Axes`` has an ``XAxis`` and a ``YAxis``.  These contain the ticks, tick locations, labels, etc.  In this tutorial, we'll mostly control ticks, tick labels, and data limits through other mechanisms, so we won't touch the individual ``Axis`` part of things all that much.  However, it is worth mentioning here to explain where the term ``Axes`` comes from.\n"
